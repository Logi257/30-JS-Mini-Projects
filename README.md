🚀 30 Days – 30 JavaScript Projects

A complete journey of building 30 real-world JavaScript projects in 30 days to sharpen my frontend skills and strengthen my fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This challenge helped me improve my logic-building, DOM manipulation skills, API handling, UI design, and consistency as a developer.
Each project is simple, interactive, and designed to improve hands-on coding experience.

🌟 Why I Did This?

I wanted to push myself, stay consistent, and build the habit of coding every single day.
This journey helped me improve my creativity, logic, and problem-solving as a developer.
